#### High Performance Sport & Software Development
There is a lot to be gained from merging these two, seemingly incompatible, knowledge bases. From Agile practices, like Scrum, Kanban, Standups, Sprints and Retrospectives, to purpose built Web Scrapers, Web Applications or APIs, there is no area of software development that would fail to positively impact current high performance sport workflows. To ensure the advancement of the sports industry and the various industries it impacts, it should be a priority of the government and national sporting bodies to make software development jobs, within sport, abundant and sought after, at the same time, ensuring good practice and educational pathways that lead to worthwhile opportunities. It is my goal to help explore and push the boundaries for software development in high performance sport, to inspire and motivate the current and next generation of stakeholders. Most recently I founded Sports Data Solutions Ltd, a company that specialises in servicing the data and software needs of elite athletes and support staff. 

Ideally I am looking to work on ambitious projects, with a focus on innovation and quality, where I could continue to develop my skills, and make a positive impact within high performance sport.
