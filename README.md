Daniel St Paul
================

Most recently a [Makers Academy, London] (http://makersacademy.com/), graduate **looking for a full-time position as a junior developer**. Took interest in software development whilst working within the sports industry due to its growing importance on how professional teams were operating. Having taken an interest in software development, Makers Academy taught me not only to write beautiful, clean and test-driven software, but to develop confidence in my ability to learn quickly and adapt to new concepts. Ideally I would like to work in a supportive environment with a focus on innovation and quality, where I could continue to learn quickly and return value.

#### Data Visualisation
Developed a liking to data visualisation during my time as a sports performance analyst. Developed my skills with small scale data projects (blogs can be read through [LinkedIn](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/danielstpaul/)) and started working on larger data when working with Sport Wales where I used Excel and [Tableau](http://www.tableau.com/).
Introduction to open-source APIs has got me interested in working with similar types of data on the web. The opportunity to further explore this would be ideal.

#### Ruby & Javascript
During my time at Makers Academy I have become more and more comfortable with Ruby and in particular Rails. I'm really proud of the [RailsAPI] (https://github.com/danielstpaul/skibuddy-backend) we made for our final project. Extrapolating the data that was required for our site from the JSON files the queries were returning really tested our problem solving skills at times!

I have been enjoying exploring Javascript and Javascript frameworks whilst at Makers Academy and after. A few of my Javascript projects whilst I was at makers can be found in my public repos on [Github](https://github.com/danielstpaul/). I am particularly proud of [Congo](https://github.com/danielstpaul/example_node_express_website), where my pair and I were able to use a new language(JS) and framework(Node Express) to build a basic website, within a week, after 6 weeks of coding.
