Daniel St Paul
================

Most recently a [Makers Academy, London] (http://makersacademy.com/), graduate **currently thugging it out as a freelancer**. Took interest in software development whilst working within the sports industry due to it's growing importance on how professional ngbs/teams were operating. Having taken an interest in software development, Makers Academy taught me not only to write beautiful, clean and test-driven software, but to develop confidence in my ability to learn quickly and adapt to new concepts. Ideally I would like to work in a supportive environment with a focus on innovation and quality, where I could continue to learn quickly and return value.
